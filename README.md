## Acknowledgement
This project was conducted under the supervision of Professor Alexandra To at Northeastern University. It is the first interactive ficiton game that I made in Twine. It would not have been possible without the help of Professor To. I would like to thank her and two of my teammates, Heng Su and Doxa Asibey for their help along the way.
